### Key Insights: ###
1. 	Geographical Presence: Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad host the majority of our 50 stores, with Bengaluru leading the pack.
2.  Campaign Performance: Diwali Campaign exhibited the highest Incremental Revenue, whereas Sankranti witnessed the highest Incremental Sold Units.
3. 	Promotional Effectiveness: Promotions like "500 cashback" and "BOGOF" showcased remarkable success rates. Conversely, "25% off" resulted in notable losses.
4.  Product Category Analysis: Products categorized under "Personal Care" demonstrated lackluster performance across both campaigns.


### Recommendations: ###
1.	Geographical Expansion: Diversify store locations to encompass other cities, tapping into unexplored consumer segments.
2.	Diwali Strategy: Emphasize on maintaining or elevating incremental revenue during Diwali campaigns, while focusing on enhancing the quantity of units sold post-promotions.
3.	Sankranti Approach: Continue prioritizing promotions that drive significant quantities sold during the Sankranti period.
4.	Promotional Tactics: Extend the utilization of successful strategies such as "500 cashback" and "BOGOF" across diverse product categories. Explore alternative promotional offers to substitute "25% off" and mitigate losses.
5.	Product Focus: Redirect focus towards Grocery, Home Care, and Appliances during festival periods, prioritizing them over Personal Care products for optimal results.
